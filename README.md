## 🎮 What Is the GTA V Cheat Menu?

The **cheat menu** is a mod-based UI overlay or injected tool that gives you full access to hundreds of in-game options—all in real time. Think of it like an in-game dev console on steroids, but with a slick interface. It loads into **story mode only** (offline use) and lets you customize everything without editing files.

Once opened (usually with a single hotkey like F4 or INSERT), the menu lets you scroll through different tabs like:

* Player settings
* Weapons
* Vehicles
* Teleport
* World/weather/time
* NPC behavior
* Visual FX

And everything is *click-to-toggle*. Instant chaos, no coding needed 😈
